I hope to learn a baseline back-end understanding of computer programming and design in this class. I have never really used C except for the brief interaction in the predecessor class, and my knowledge of docker is also limited, but I know these are very popular in the industry. So I hope to get an almost seamless understanding of both C and Docker, of course, with plenty of room for improvement. I also only used GitHub very briefly, and using the push, add, commit, and pull commands was a nice refresher of my skills.
